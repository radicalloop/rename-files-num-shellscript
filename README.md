# rename-files-num-shellscript
(Linux only) Shell script to rename files in a directory numerically, based on file's modified date-time.


Just place `rename-files.sh` inside the directory whose files need to be renamed, give proper permissions to it, and run it from the terminal.

- `chmod 0777 rename-files.sh`

- `./rename-files.sh`
